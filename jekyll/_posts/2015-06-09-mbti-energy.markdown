# The Four Dichotomy’s

## Energy
How we are energised?

### Intravert

* Draw energy from an internal world of thought and reflection
* Reflect, act, reflect further
* Communicate by writing
* Good listeners
* Activity in the outside world tends to lead to a decline in energy and motivation, requiring opportunity for inner thought and reflection in a more quiet environment to recharge.
* Rechargeable battery

### Extravert
* Draw energy from an external world of interaction and doing
* Tend to act first, then reflect, then act further
* Tend to prefer to communicate by talking
* Often considered good talkers
* Inactivity, thought, and reflection tends to lead to a decline in energy and motivation, requiring interaction with people and things to recharge.
* “Solar Panels”
