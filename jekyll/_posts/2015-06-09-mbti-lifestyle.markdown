External lifestyle we prefer to lead.

# Judging
* Planned and organised
* Feel supported by structure, guidelines, and standardised methods
* Dislike surprises and changes.
* Gain satisfaction from ticking off completed tasks on a list
* Complete projects in a step-by-step

# Perceiving
* Appear to have no plan, act spontaneously
* Flexible and adaptable
* Enjoy freedom and variety. Resist or fight against structure, rules, plans, etc
* Enjoy surprise and change
* May use lists. Add to, alter, then lose.
