How we make decisions

# Thinking

* Search for principles and logic when making decisions
* Outcome / goal focused
* Objective, dispassionate in decision making
* True / False, Black / White
* Conflict accepted as a natural and normal part of relationships.
* Enjoy being recognised for results
* Decisions are made with the Head.

# Feeling

* Use personal feelings and values when making decisions
* Process focused
* Subjective decision making, striving to maintain harmony for all involved.
* Good / Bad.
* May grey area - not that simple.
* Conflict is unsettling and avoided at all costs
* Enjoy being appreciated for their contribution
* Decisions are made with the heart.
